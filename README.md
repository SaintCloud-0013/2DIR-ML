# 2DIR pre-trained model
This package provides a universal transfer learning model based on 2DIR spectra analysis. Having assimilated signal features from approximately 204,300 spectra, the model effectively establishes a correlation between spectra and protein conformations. It excels at accurately predicting the dynamic secondary structure content along protein folding trajectories.
